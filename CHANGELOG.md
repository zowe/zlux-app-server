# Zlux App Server Changelog

All notable changes to the Zlux App Server package will be documented in this file.

## v2.9.0

- Bugfix: Recognizers from multiple plugins could not be merged due to an error in the merge code execution at startup.

## v2.7.0

- Bugfix: Explicitly prefer ipv4 dns results to be compatible with node 18 since it switched to prefer ipv6 without configuration. This behavior can be cusomized via components.app-server.dns.lookupOrder='ipv4' or 'ipv6'. It defaults to 'ipv4'.

## v2.4.0

- Bugfix: Plugin register/deregister would not consider app2app actions and recgonizers. Now, they are added on registration and removed on deregistration.

## v2.3.0

- Enhancement: app-server can now be configured by using configmgr. This increases startup time and validation of components and their plugins to increase automatic detection of plugin compatibility issues. This mode can be enabled or disabled with zowe configuration property 'zowe.useConfigmgr=true/false'
- Bugfix: Schema regex pattern for semver range was not working in configmgr, and has been corrected

## v2.0.0

- Enhancement: Renamed ZLUX_ environment variables to ZWED_ for consistency. Backwards compatible with old environment variables.
- Enhancement: Support new logDirectory variable specification in zowe.yaml
- Enhancement: Support reading from zowe.yaml instead of server.json

## v1.27.0

- Bugfix: Fix development environment case in which app-server would crash without agent config being fully defined.

## v1.25.0

- Enhancement: Changed how app-server scripts locate app-server directories so that they work in container mode, where the folder layout is different. This unifies container and non-container location behavior.
- Enhancement: Use GATEWAY_HOST env var over ZOWE_EXPLORER_HOST to find mediation layer gateway if hostname not explicitly specified elsewhere

## v1.24.0

- Bugfix: IP Explorer was not installed upon upgrade, only on new installs.


## v1.23.0

- Bugfix: Sync state of certificate verification of zlux with keystore configuration, so that certificate verification can be turned on or off centrally
- Enhancement: Automatically create APIML static definition for ZSS when app-server is running in Docker.

## v1.22.0

- Bugfix: Prefer internal IP/hostname over external one when stating to discovery server where app-server is located. For many users there is no behavior difference because the values are the same.

## v1.21.0

- Bugfix: Set the hostname used for eureka to match the value of ZWE_EXTERNAL_HOSTS if exists, or otherwise ZOWE_EXLORER_HOST, for the purpose of avoiding certificate verification issues between app-server and APIML under certain circumstances

## v1.20.0

- Added a manifest file, a validate script, and refactored configure, start, and app-server scripts to better conform to zowe lifecycle management standards

## v1.17.0

- Bugfix: make use of external certificate authorities referenced during keystore setup time

## v1.16.0

- Bugfix: Changes to terminal settings in instance.env would not take effect post-install, causing the initial values to be permenent unless users set personalized settings
- Feature: More terminal settings present in the UI can be set as defaults from instance.env. TN3270 mod type can be set by ZOWE_ZLUX_TN3270_MOD, and the row and column by ZOWE_ZLUX_TN3270_ROW and ZOWE_ZLUX_TN3270_COL. ZOWE_ZLUX_TN3270_CODEPAGE also can be used to set the default codepage to a value which matches the strings seen in the UI, such as "278: Finnish/Swedish" for EBCDIC-278. As a shorthand, just the number can be set as well, such as "278".

## v1.13.0

- Align app server's instance ID parameter to the Zowe Instance value

## v1.12.0

- Add v1.12 update script for replacing all bundled plugin references with ones that use $ROOT_DIR environment variable
- Change Scripts to work with independent zss component
- Add v1.12 update script for removing apiml-auth if it is not being explicitly used
