      description: When writing to a Unix File, the process must be done in chunks of 3MB or less. Please note that your first request will fail because you haven't been assigned a sessionID. If you don't have a sessionID in your request, then the server will assign you one and send it as a response. Please attach this sessionID to every subsequent request as a query parameter. This sessionID is linked to a particular file, so you must use it for the duration of the upload. If you lose it, then the file will be inaccessible via this API until your session timesout in five minutes. When you have specified lastChunk as true, then that signals the end of the upload session; thus, you have sent all the contents of the file.
